# Yet another useless helper for maintaing windows on android called *Holy Helper*

Inspired by [original helper](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-helper)

THIS PROJECT IS IN AN EARLY ALPHA AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL THE FEATURES

### Available functions:
 - Device detection
 - Backup of boot partition
 - Boot in windows
 - Proper landscape mode (unlike [original helper](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-helper))
 - Mounting in /mnt instead of /sdcard
